#### Classification of musical records into genres based on its lyrics ðŸŽ¶.

Have you ever wondered how much song lyrics define the song vibe and genre?  
Would you be able to correctly guess song genre just given its lyrics?  
In this repo I am trying to teach ML algorithms to "feel" songs given their lyrics by correctly classifying their genre.

Dataset: over 3 million songs from [Genius song lyrics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information)   
Genres:   country, pop, rap, rb, rock.  
Approaches:
1. We start with the linear approach: TF-IDF for vectorization; TruncatedSVD for reducing dimensionality and sparsity; LogisticRegression (elastic net) for classification; RandomizedSearchCV for hyper-parameter optimization.
